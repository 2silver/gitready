## About

This repository hosts the HTML, CSS, images, and posts for [gitready.com](http://gitready.com)<br />
Git Ready publishes daily tips for those who want to learn more about the VCS or just get started.

## Publishing

This blog is generated with the [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) engine, [forked here](http://github.com/qrush/jekyll) with some special modifications.<br />
Simple and easy formatting that sticks to the basics. All static HTML too, so worrying about scalability is non-existent.

## Contributing

If you have ideas about new pages, layouts, or what have you, fork away!<br />
If you want to submit tips, [please do so here](http://gitready.com/submit.html).

## Translating

If you are interested in translating posts into another language, great! Here's what to do:

* Fork the project.
* Create a branch with the ISO code for your language 
* Translate as little or as many posts as you so desire.
* The posts that aren't translated, add this to the YAML front matter (this way, untranslated posts don't show up):

    published: false

* Submit a pull request to the main repository.

Once that's done, I'll add your language's subdomain and get it published.
