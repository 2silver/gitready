## About

Daily tips about Git for beginners to advanced users for those who want to learn more or just get started.

## Publishing

This blog is generated with the [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) engine, [forked here](http://github.com/qrush/jekyll) with some special modifications.
Simple and easy formatting that sticks to the basics. All static HTML too, so worrying about scalability is non-existent.

## Contributing

If you have ideas about new pages, layouts, or what have you, fork away! 
If you want to submit tips, [please do so here](http://gitready.com/qrush/gitready).

## Translating

If you are interested in translating posts into another language, great! Here's what to do:

* Fork the project.
* Create a branch with the ISO code for your language 
* Translate as little or as many posts as you so desire.
* The posts that aren't translated, add this to the YAML front matter (this way, untranslated posts don't show up):

	published: false

* Submit a pull request to the main gitready repository.

Once that's done, I'll add your language's subdomain and get it published.
