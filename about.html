  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    If you're looking for pointers (no pun intended) on how to use git, look no further! 
    The goal with this site is to make it usable as a way for beginners to get off the
    ground using Git and to show those who are already familiar with Git some new tricks.

    Want to contribute? Fantastic! Hit up the contribute link at the bottom if you have
    better ideas of how to lay out the content, etc. If you want to submit a tip, there's
    a link on the footer as well.
